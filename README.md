## Dataset    
The token-level transformer relies on the pre-trained transformers, which can be downloed from [here](https://huggingface.co/).
<br>The raw dataset of the earnings call can be found from [ACL-19, Qin and Yang](https://github.com/GeminiLn/EarningsCall_Dataset).

## Model
We provide our code and data used for the paper. Our HTML model consists with token-level transformer and sentence-level transformer which can be found at the Model path. Also, we provide our experimental code using Multi-task settings and Single-task settings respectively.
